# Portfolio

## About

This is my first attempt in creating a personal portfolio website.
I wanted this website to be simple and user-friendly. Also, I really wanted to use this experience to apply the HTML and CSS skills I had learnt up till this point.

## How to access

https://khush2706.github.io/
Best used with Google Chrome.

## Inspiration

The layout was heavily inspired by Sean Halpin's personal portfolio website (seanhalpin.io) and can be seen through the shots below. I really liked the simplicity of his work, the playful feel of the whole website, and the general flat design. I hoped to emulate this onto mine.

## Typography and Icons

I used Google Fonts:
- Merriweather
- Montserrat
- Tangerine

Icons:
- Font Awesome (http://fontawesome.io/icons/)
- Flat Icons (http://www.flaticon.com/categories/web)
- Favicon (https://www.favicon.cc/)

## Looking ahead

This website was the first project I had worked on by myself from scratch which utilized both HTML and CSS. It is quite a simple attempt but something I am happy to have got through! I have learnt a lot through this project and am looking forward to making more and better projects.

Hope you enjoy! :)
